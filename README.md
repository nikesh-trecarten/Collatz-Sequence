# Collatz Sequence

This is a personal project for practicing my coding skills in React that I am working on in my free time with no set timeline.

It is based on the the Collatz Sequence, which divides an even number in half and multiplies an odd number by 3 and adds 1,
repeating the cycle until it inevitably reaches 1.

script.js is a simple program that serves as the main inspiration for the broader project.
